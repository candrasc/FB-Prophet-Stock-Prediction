# FB Prophet Stock Prediction

This notebook compares the performance of a basic vs tuned FB prophet model at predicting Apple's stock price for the year of 2019 based on historical trends. The evaluation metrics used were Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Average Percent Error (MAPE). 

Future iterations of this project will include cross validation for different time periods as well as a more robust pipleine to allow any stock to be predicted for any year.
